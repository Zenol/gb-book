Why writing a Game Boy emulator
-------------------------------

Why would you write a Nintendo Game Boy emulator?
I mean, it's a really old device.
Nintendo released it in 1989 in japan.
Most of the game on this console are
now outclassed by today's game, and only few old nostalgic only play those games.
Furthermore, one can see more than two hundred project of such emulators
on github.
Knowing that there already exist really good Game Boy and
Game Boy Color emulators like BGB Gambatte that aim at
reproducing accurately the game boy hardware's behavior, why would you
join this run years after the start was given?

The reason become clear, once you ask the right question.
What is the right question?
Let me state it black on white:

>  Why would you write a 8-bit computer emulator?

Because, this is exactly what is a Nintendo Game Boy.
It's a computer, with all the components you can find in today's computer.
It is just a little bit older, and a lot simpler and easier to
understand than today's computer.
And since our computers are a lot more faster,
you don't have to worry too much about speed and performance
of a Game Boy emulator implementation.
To state it simply, a Game Boy emulator is one of the best project
-- if not the best -- to jump
in the world of computer emulation.

If you like learning, if you want to understand deeper what is the GPU for,
how the CPU schedule all the hardware components, and the importance of memory
mapping, welcome to this book.
You are about the start one of the most intense journey of you life.
Take some coffee, and sit comfortably. Let's start.

Prerequisites
-------------

Through this book, I assume you are already familar with
a programming language (preferably an imperative one).
If you know C, Rust, C++, or even Java, C#, JS or python you are fine.
Strongly typed functionnal languages (like Haskell) can easily make this
exercice a lot harder (debugguing becomes hard
whereas the type system do not provide an easy way to enforce the
right comportement through function types).

This book contain code samples written in Rust.
You don't need to know this language to follow this book.
Examples can be easily adapted to languages previously cited, and Rust remain
very close to C by it's syntax, which was then inherited by many today's languages.

Although it is usually not recommended learning a new language
while writing an
emulator, it is indeed what many peoples actually does.
If you want to learn Rust while building your emulator,
it is something realizable, and have already been done by
some persons.
Just ask yourself if you feel confident enough to
learn a language at the same time, or if you
are new to the world of emulator and want to learn thing once at
a time.
If all the points that will be treated in this section seams new to you,
you might prefer to stick to a language you already know.

### Hexadecimal and binary systems
Let's recall a few things about numbers and
numeric systems.

The number twenty-three is written by two
digits, a `2` and a `3` from left to right.
Since we use the _decimal_ system, it means
that the first digit count how many packets of 10 objects we have,
and the second how objects we have.
Formally `23` states for _two times ten and 3_.
Since we use the decimal system every day, we forget (or just didn't know)
this details.

But what happen if we want to count in packet of 16, 8, or 2?
We name this new counting systems respectively hexadecimal, octal and
binary.
To count in hexadecimal, the first digits are
`0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `9`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`.
We introduce the six missing symbols in order to reach the number 15.
And so, what do we do once we reached `F`?
Like in the decimal system, we add a new column, on the left.
In hexadecimal, we have :
`F`, `10`, `11`, `12`, ..., `19`, `1A`, `1B`...

That is, you know how to count in hexadecimal.
But wait, if you see `10`, does it mean ten in decimal,
or sixteen written in hexadecimal?

Only the person who wrote this number can tell you.
In order to tell people the quantity is an hexadecimal number,
we usually prefix hexadecimal numbers by `0x`.
This way, we know that `0x10` stands for sixteen
and `10` stands for ten.

But why using this strange numbering while we have
our good old decimal system?
Before answering this question, let me
show you the binary system.

In binary, we only need two digits. We choose to keep `0` and `1`.
Counting goes:
`0`, `1`, `10`, `11`, `100`, `101`, `110`, ...

Not really economic in symbol.
But the trick with this numbering system is that
the value of each column can be represented by an
electric wire with a voltage of zero (`0`) or
a positive voltage (`1`).

That is actually how numbers are stored in computer.
Usually, we like to pack binary digits by height.
A digit in a binary number is called a bit.
As before, we add the prefix `0b` before binary number
to distinguish them from decimals.
For example, `0b00000111` means seven.

What is the biggest number you can write with four
digits? It's fifteen, `0b1111` in binary or
`0xF` in hexadecimal.
If we look at pocket of heights bits, usually
called bytes, we get two symbols in hexadecimal.
Instead of writing `0b01110001` we can just write
`0x71` which is a lot easier to read.

Binary operation like _and_ means that you take
your two numbers, you write them in binary
one above the other, and
you keep only the column that both have `1`.

Example:
```
     0b11000111
AND  0b01001010
=    0b01000010
```

We usually write this operation `0xC7 & 0x4A = 0x42`.

There is other binary operations like _or_ (it is enough to have a one in
a column to keep it) noted with the pipe symbol `|`.
Some others are the negation (replacing `0` by `1` and `1` by `0`),
binary shift (shift the digits on the right or on the left)
and binary rotation (just rotate the bits like if they were
written around a cylinder).
A last one, widely used, is the _xor_ of two numbers, noted `^`.
It stands for _eXclusive or_, and means that you keep a `1`
in a column only if the two numbers have different digit.
If both have the same digit, you place a `0`.

Get familiar with this operations if its not already the case.

Architecture of an 8-bit computer
--------------------------------

Before writing the first line of code, lets describe
the elementary block of hardware you would find
in the console, and how they relate to each other.
Surely, this organization will influence the design
of your implementation.

### The CPU
The Central Process Unit, also known as
CPU for short, is the heart (actually, the brain) of
a computer.
A processor does three things.
First int read an instruction from memory.
Then, it decodes this instruction.
It means reading the right number of arguments of
the instruction from memory.
Finally, it executes the instruction.
The instruction can be adding two numbers, loading some
value from memory at a specified location, writing at this location,
and many other elementary actions.

Those free actions are called together the fetch–decode–execute cycle, or
instruction cycle.

The CPU keeps repeating these cycle from start
to the end of world (or more realistically,
until the end of your battery).

To perform his job, the CPU has access to a set
of internal registers.
Some store data, other address, and some are used to
control the processor.

A list of the Game Boy CPU's register can be found in annex A.
Let describe the ones you are likely to find in
any computer.

#### Working registers
The _working registers_ are small variables
contained inside the CPU, that can accessed without
cost.
The size of the registers are linked to the architecture of the
processor.
An 8 bit processor have registers of size 8bits,
whereas 32 bits and 64 bits architecture have
respectively registers of size 4 bytes and 8 bytes.
Usually, there is an _Accumulator_ register,
often called `A`, which is used to store the
result of arithmetic and binary operations.
Often we can also find a register `C` called
the _Counter_ which is often used for...
yes, counting, you get it.

#### Program counter
The _program counter_ is a special
register which store the address of the
next instruction to fetch.
It can be controller thanks to
instructions like `JUMP`, `JNZ`, `CALL`
and `RET` which change its values
for conditional branching or function call.

#### Stack pointer
The _stack pointer_ is a register which store the address
of the stack.
The stack is a location in the memory where
registers can be _pushed_ (wrote) and
_poped_ (restored, and the value is thrown).
The data structure is a stack, which
means that you have to retrieve the values
in the reverse order you placed them.
The stack is used right after a function call
in order to save the values of the registers
the function is going to use.
Before quitting the
function, the values are retrieved from the stack.
The stack can also be used for storing any kind of
intermediate value when there is not enough registers.

#### Status register
Status registers contains two kinds of values.
First, it contains values that allow to control the processor.
An example is the enabling and disabling of interrupts, controlled
through the interrupt flag (a flag is a one bit register).
The seconds are values affected by the result of the previous
instruction (carry, flag that indicate if the result was zero, ...).
The first type of values are controlled through
dedicated instructions.
For example, the instruction `EI` set the interrupt flag to on.
The second type are used by some instructions like conditional jumps.

### The memory
The memory is another central part of the hardware.
The cpu communicate with the memory through the memory BUS
(from the Latin word omnibus).
The memory bus is a set of conductors (usually directly drawn on the circuit)
that allow the communication between the memory chips and the CPU.
To retrieving a specific byte, a number called the address
is sent by the CPU to the memory chips.
The memory allow storing the instruction executed by the processor,
but also the graphics and divers data of the games.

### IO
IO Stands for Input and Output.
It's basically any comunication from the processor to any other
device including the screen, and the joypad.
In the gameboy, IO are acessed through the strategy of memory mapping.
Memory maping is allowing other devices to communicate with the CPU by
sharing the address buss with them.
Specific ranges of addresses are routed to devices instead
of the memory chips.
For example, the memory of the GPU (Graphic Process unit) corresponding
to the tiles displayed by the gameboy is mapped to certain plage of
addresses.
To change the display of the screen, all the CPU has to do is to write
to this specific adresse at the right timing.
For knowing which buttons of the joypad are pressed by
the player, the CPU can read a byte from a specific address.

### Interupts
Interupts are signal, either from the CPU itself (when an internal counter overflow) or external devices (like the LCD screen of the Game Boy) that
tell the CPU to stop the normal flow of execution
When the Game Boy's processor receive an interuption,
it finish his instruction cycle, push the
current value of the Pointer Counter register
on the stack, and jump to a specific adress corresponding to
the interruption handler for this instruction.
This block of code, named the interuption handler,
is executed until the processor reach a specific instruction that
tells him to go back to the normal flow
of execution.
