The memory
==========

Loading the rom
---------------

Rom files are backup of the data stored in the Nintendo Game Boy's cartridge.
At this time, memory was very expensive.
It was both difficult to have huge amount of memory and memory chips was costly.
Therefor, cartridge has diferent sizes.
The smallest ones, like tetris, had a single "memory bank".
As a start, we will only load the lightweigh games like Tetris which are
usualy stored in a file with extension `.gb`.
