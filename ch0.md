Why writing a Game Boy emulator
-------------------------------

Why would you write a Nintendo Game Boy emulator?
I mean, it's a really old device.
Nintendo released it in 1989 in japan.
Most of the game on this console are
now outclassed by today's game, and only few old nostalgic only play those games.
Furthermore, one can see more than two hundred project of such emulators
on github.
Knowing that there already exist really good Game Boy and
Game Boy Color emulators like BGB Gambatte that aim at
reproducing accurately the game boy hardware's behavior, why would you
join this run years after the start was given?

The reason become clear, once you ask the right question.
What is the right question?
Let me state it black on white:

>  Why would you write a 8-bit computer emulator?

Because, this is exactly what is a Nintendo Game Boy.
It's a computer, with all the components you can find in today's computer.
It is just a little bit older, and a lot simpler and easier to
understand than today's computer.
And since our computers are a lot more faster,
you don't have to worry too much about speed and performance
of a Game Boy emulator implementation.
To state it simply, a Game Boy emulator is one of the best project
-- if not the best -- to jump
in the world of computer emulation.

If you like learning, if you want to understand deeper what is the GPU for,
how the CPU schedule all the hardware components, and the importance of memory
mapping, welcome to this book.
You are about the start one of the most intense journey of you life.
Take some coffee, and sit comfortably. Let's start.
