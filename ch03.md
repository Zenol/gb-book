Graphic Process Unit 
====================

The second main part of a Game Boy emulator is the emulation
of Graphic Process Unit.
The GPU is, in today's computer, a chip on the graphic
card that have the purpose of computing the graphic randering
from the information stored in memory.
In our case, the GPU core of our emulator will be
essentially the code responsible for rendering the pixels of a
160x144 window.

We will introduce a buffer which will play the role of a
virtual screen.
It will contain the color
(white, light grey, dark grey or block) that would be displayed by
a real Game Boy during the run of a game.
The GPU core will have to maintain the color of this screen
up to date during the emulation.

In the real hardware, the GPU update the pixels line per line.
Drawing a line require access to specific part of memory
which become innaccessible for the CPU.
Therefore the GPU have to respect special timing to
also allow the processor to access this part of memory,
so that the CPU can set the current graphics of the game.

The GPU respect the timing of the old fat cathode-ray tube (CRT) screens.
In this old screen, a ray of electron goes horizontaly through a line.
Then, the ray is turned off, and is moved to the begining off the next line.
When the beam reach the end of the screen, it is moved back to
begining of the top line.

<CTR Timing>

The diferent states in details are :

+----------------------------+
| Scanline (accessing OAM)   |
+----------------------------+
| Scanline (accessing VRAM)  |
+----------------------------+
| Horizontal Blank           |
+----------------------------+
| Vertical Blank             |
+----------------------------+


We are going to simulate this timing by changing a variable describing the current state (
