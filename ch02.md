The CPU core
============

Now, you can load a game into memoory, but once the gamme is in the memory,
nothing happen. You need to emulate the heart of the Game Boy:
the GPU.
This section is devoted to structuring and writing the CPU core,
the part of the emulater responsible for fetching instructions,
and reproducing the behavior of a single instructions on our memory.


Registers, and first instructions
---------------------------------

### Registers described and first rust code line


### Emulaters are inherently slows


### Architecture (call ptr[opcode] or ptr[op], v1 = readbyte, v2 = readyte.)


# MBC


# Annex A
CPU's registers
# Annex B
CPU Opcode table 1
CPU Opcode table 2
